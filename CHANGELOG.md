# Unreleased

* Fix modals not properly closing when replaced within a `<turbo-frame>`
* Add `toggleInput` to toggle to sync with input checkbox or radio state

# 4.0.4

* Fix transitions by removing any end classes before beginning.
  For example, let's say you have a modal backdrop of `bg-opacity-80` initially and your transition starts with `bg-opacity-0` and ends with `bg-opacity-80`.
  Previously, this would start the transition with `bg-opacity-80 bg-opacity-0` and not remove the initial class. This would seem to not transition because of CSS ordering where `bg-opacity-80` might always take precedence.
  By removing the end classes at the beginning of the transition, we can ensure that conflicting classes do not cause problems with the transition.
* Unlock browser scroll after modal transitions instead of before. This fixes an issue where the modal gets bumped left during the leave transition.

# 4.0.3

* Fix modal scroll position when opening

# 4.0.2

* Only animate toggle when an action happens (not on connect)

# 4.0.1

* Tabs index now selects panels and no longer requires tabs
* Add closeTarget to Slideover

# 4.0.0

* [Breaking] Complete refactor to take advantage of new Stimulus features, completely rewrite transitions, and more! ðŸŽ‰
* [Breaking] The main export is now cjs format and the module export is esm. We've dropped other formats as part of the move to esbuild.
* [Breaking] Use `data-action"controller#method:prevent` to call `preventDefault` where needed. Components will no longer prevent default automatically.
* Transitions now follow the TailwindCSS enter/leave pattern. This is based on the el-transition library.
    ```html
    <div class="hidden whatever default styles"
         data-transition-enter="transition duration-300"
         data-transition-enter-from="opacity-0"
         data-transition-enter-to="opacity-100"
         data-transition-leave="transition duration-300"
         data-transition-leave-from="opacity-100"
         data-transition-leave-to="opacity-0"
         >
      Content fades opacity over 300ms
    </div>
    ```
    These should be applied to the element that will transition. For example, apply these attributes to the menu element of a Dropdown.
* Alert transition classes have been moved to the transition API.
* Autosave now uses `requestSubmit` for submitting the form.
* Autosave now has configurable submitDuration, statusDuration, submittingText, successText, and errorText.
* ColorPreview now uses styleValue instead of `data-style` to define which CSS style it applies to (color, backgroundColor, etc).
* Dropdown transition classes have been moved to the transition API.
* Modal transition classes have been moved to the transition API.
* Modals now use a backgroundTarget to customize the background. `backdropColorValue` has been removed since this should be specified on your backdrop instead.
* Modals now use the `open` value to trigger the opening and closing of the modal.
* Popover transition classes have been moved to the transition API.
* Popovers now use `show` and `hide` instead of `mouseOver` and `mouseOut`.
* Slideovers transition classes have been moved to the transition API.
* Tabs now use activeTab and inactiveTab Stimulus classes
* Tabs also store the selected index in the indexValue
* Tabs can be set to update the URL anchor when a tab is selected using `updateAnchorValue`
* Toggles now support the transition API.
